            Exception               Error
    Checked         Unchecked
    HOW TO HANDLE EXCEPTIONS?
    Unchecked: we can only use try-catch-finally blocks
    Checked: They are 2 ways
    1. use try-catch-finally blocks
    2. add to method signature using "Throws" keyword

    What is final, finalize, and finally?
    final: non-access modifier
        final class: cannot be inherited
        final methods: cannot be overridden
        final instance variables: must be initialized and
        cannot be reassigned (changed)

    finalize(): it is a method related to garbage collection
        it is located at Object class, and you can override it in
        your classes and run a block of code for proper cleaning when
        garbage collection happens

    finally: it is a block used together with try or try-catch
        blocks. It will always execute a last block of code

    Difference between "throw" and "throws" keywords
    throw: is used to throw an exception (basically you are creating
    an exception)

    throws: is used to handle checked exceptions by adding
    exception to the method signature
