        Where do you think testing starts in the SDLC?
        - Testing is in all the SDLC phases
        In testing phase we are executing the test cases and making sure that
        the functionalities are working as expected and bug free.

        The difference between validation and verification:
        - Verification: Going through the documentation and understand
        the requirement
        - Validation: After the development is completed, it is time to test
        the functionality if it is working.

        Scrum: It is Agile process to get the highest business value in shortest tim
               It is not methodology, it is framework

        User Stories: Application divided into pieces which is called User Story

        Backlog Grooming Meeting: As a team we are getting together to prioritize
        the User Stories in the backlog.
        - It happens biweekly.
        - We discuss the details and adding them to user story
        - We estimate the delivery time and give point to the start

        Sprint Planning Meeting: As a scrum we are having the meeting
        that move user stories from product backlog to sprint backlog
        Sometimes SME (Subject Matter Expert) and stakeholders are joining the meeting (biweekly)
        Daily Scrum (Stand Up) meeting: It happens every for 15 to 30 minutes.
        Each scrum team member is talking what they did yesterday, what planning to do today
        and if there are any blockers or impediment
        For example, testing environment is down, and I am not able to execute my testing.

        User Story starts:
        As a user, I should be able to log in to the application.
