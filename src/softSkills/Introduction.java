        /*
        1) Planning:
              - Business Idea
              - Gather the requirements from the customer
              - Analyzing the requirements
              - Time needed works for both the team and the customer
        2) Design:
              - Structure is discussed here
              - Decide on Programming Language ( Java, Java Script, Ruby, Python, etc..)
              - Supported browsers
              - Understanding Front End and Back End
        3) Development:
              - Developers start to write code
              - As QA tester, we start to develop test cases
              - Also understand requirements
              - Design updates
        4) Testing
              - Locate bugs
              - Creating test cases for future features
              -  Automate test cases
        5) Deployment:
              - Moving the code to production
        6) Maintenance:
              - Continue to monitor software for any bugs and performance issues

        Why are we learning SDLC? SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LYFE CYCLE
        - To know:
            1) Technical requirements
            2) Cost of the project, we create produce evaluate the time the team amount f eople how much it will all cost ang
            give to the clients the estimate so you kno how much you can earn and if it satisfies the client

        CLASS 2:
        Difference between Agile vs Waterfall:
        - Agile is flexible                                          - Waterfall is a Linear Sequential Life Cycle Model
        - Agile follows incremental and iterative approaches         - Waterfall is structured
        - Testing is performed concurrently with software            - The "Testing" phase comes after the "Development" phase
        development

        Soft Skills Class 3
        Why do we need Agile
        - One part of the application fails all the application were failing
        - Meet the frequently changed requirements
        - Cannot wait for whole application and deployed
        - you can fix all the bugs before the development needed
        Values of Agile
        - Responding to change rather than following a plan
        - Customer collaboration over rigid contracts

       Principles of Agile
       - Satisfy the customer
       - Welcome changing requirements
       - Deliver working software frequently
       - Frequent interaction with Stakeholders
       - Motivate individuals
       - Face to face communication
