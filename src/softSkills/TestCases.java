        Test Cases - 1:
        Positive Test Cases
        - a type of testing which is performed on a software application by
        providing the valid data sets as an input
        - It checks whether the software application behaves as expected
        with positive inputs or not
        - Positive testing is performed in order to check whether the
        software application does exactly what it is expected to
        Negative Test Cases
        - a testing method performed on the software application by
        providing invalid or improper data sets as input
        - It checks whether the software application behaves as expected with
        negative or unwanted user inputs
        - The purpose of negative testing is to ensure that the software
        application does not crash and remains stable with invalid data inputs

        How to write a Test Case in Software Testing?
            Preparing to write a test case:
            - Check if a test case already exists. If yes, consider updating test
            case, rather than writing a new one.
            - Make sure the test case has certain characteristics like accuracy,
            tracing, repetition, re-usability, and independence.
            - Consider all the different scenarios possible before writing.
            - Give yourself enough time to write test cases.
            Writing a test case:
            - Select a tool for writing a test case.
            - Write a test case in the format discussed earlier.
            - Write basic test statements.
            - Review written test cases thoroughly.

        How do you make sure that you are covering all the
        possible scenarios for the user story?
        - Go through the testes with the developer related to the case,
        then with the product owners, if they are available, and set up meeting
        for 1 hour with other testers, and you test the cases together to make
        sure nothing is skipped.
