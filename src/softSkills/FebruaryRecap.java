        Product backlog:
        - it is artifact that we are storing the user stories based on the priority.
        - it is basically the list of tasks
        User story:
        - it is task
        - The smallest part of the application where requirements are written
         from user's perspective
         Agile & Waterfall
         Agile: Incremental and iterative approach to manage the project. It
         is flexible, and you can go back and forth between phases.
         Waterfall: Linear and sequential approach to manage the project. It
         is strict, you cannot go back to previous phase

         SCRUM:
         Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering
         the highest business value in the shortest period of time

         Scrum ceremonies:
         There are four scrum ceremonies:

         - Sprint Planning (Before sprint, usually Wednesday, every two weeks)
         - Daily Scrum (Stand up)
         - Sprint review
         - Retro Meeting

         Backlog Grooming meeting: It is held every two weeks and
         all scrum team members are attending. Also, other
         people can be invited based on the requirement

         Three Amigos Meeting
         Three amigos refers to the primary perspectives to examine an increment of
         work before, during, and after development. Those perspectives are:
         - Business - What problem are we trying to solve?
         - Development - How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
         - Testing - What about this, what could possibly happen?

         People holding these different perspectives should collaborate to
         define what to do and agree on how they know when it is done
         correctly.
         SPRINT:
         A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works
         to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart
         of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will
         help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.
         PARKING-LOT MEETING
         - In the stand-up meeting each team member is updating the status
         based on the tasks or stories on the Spring board. If any team member
         has issue and discussion would take more time and it does fit the purpose
         of the stand-up meeting, so team member whoever is related to this issue
         stays in the meeting after the stand-up.

         The Topic in the Retro Meeting:
         1. Pointing the User story
         2. Requirements are not clear
         3. Prioritization issue on the Backlog
         4. Communication

         Positive topics
         1. Team is doing great job finishing the user stories
         2. Tech lead is so responsive solving the problem
         3. Development team is helping understand the flow.
         SCRUM VALUES:
         - Commitment
         - Courage
         - Focus
         - Openness
         - Respect
         Daily Scrum meeting:
         it is a 15-minute daily meeting where team gets on the same page and discuss
         three questions listed below:
         1) What was done yesterday by the scrum team that helped
         meet the sprint goal?
         2) What will be done today that will help
         meet the sprint goal?
         3) Are there impediments that are preventing the team from
         meeting the sprint goal?

         User story is the smallest piece of the application
         Those user stories are stored in the Product Backlog
         Example of the user story:
         - As a user, I should be able to register to the application
            Each user story has requirements called Acceptance criteria;
         Acceptance Criteria (AC)
            - User should be able to register with the valid personal data
            - User should have valid email
            - User should have minimum 8 chars of password
         - As a user, I should be able to log in to the application
         - Above statement is a template usually we are using its
         work for the User stories

         There is a tool called JIRA which is for managing the project.
