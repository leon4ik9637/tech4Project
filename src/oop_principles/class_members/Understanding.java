        CLASS MEMBERS:
        1. constructor
        2. instance variables - attributes - states - fields
        3. methods - functions - behaviors
        4. blocks

        - Fields are also known as instance variables and defines all
        the attributes of the objects of that class
        - Methods are also known as functions of the class and defines
        behaviors of the objects of that class
        - Constructors are kind of special methods and enable us to
        create objects of the class

        Blocks are known as static and instance blocks and get
        executed first by JVM

        NOTE: Java is Object-Oriented Programming language
        - These languages are object-based
        - Java has an Object class that is parent to any class by
        default
        - OOP languages are used to put real-life problems into classes
        and objects and provide solution to many useful class members.

        - Programming languages can be used to create software
        - Software is created to resolve real life problems
        - Java is an object-oriented programming
        - The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break
        complex problems into smaller objects. So, Object-oriented
        simply known as an approach to programming that breaks a
        programming problem into objects
        - Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects
        - Different Java objects can interact with each other


        Class: It is a blueprint from where many objects can be
        instantiated.
            How to create a class:
            accessModifier class ClassName{
                // class members
            }
            Ex:
            class Car{
                public Car(){

                }
            }

        Object: It is an instance of a class.
            How to instantiate an object:
            ClassName variableName = new ClassName();
            Car car1 = new Car();
            Car car2 = new Car();
         */

    }
}
