        Class (Blueprint - Real life -> Java)
            1. Constructor
                a. Special method for creating objects
                b. We can overload it
            2. Instance variables, attributes, fields, states
                a. Description of the object or class
                b. Non-static (object), static (class)
            3. Methods, functions, behaviors
                a. Actions for objects or class
                b. Reusable
            4. Blocks (static, non-static, instance blocks)
                a. Getting executed before everything
                b. Static runs 1 time, non-static runs multiple times

        Class: Blueprint from where we create objects
        Object: Instance of a class

        Class Members:
        1. Constructor: special method allows to create objects
        2. Instance variables: features of an object
        3. Methods: functions of a class or objects
        4. Blocks: are used to instantiate instance variables or
        used to execute a block of code either before the main method
        once or for each instance being created
        static block: executes once and before everything else
        instance block: executes for each object being created

        OOP Principles
        1. Inheritance: child-parent relationship - reusability of code
        2. Polymorphism: one object being able to get into many shapes
            List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
            ArrayList<String> list2 = new ArrayList<>();

            Ex. Mercedes is a Car.
            Mercedes is a Vehicle.
            Mercedes is an Object.

            Car c1 = new Mercedes();
            Vehicle c2 = new Mercedes();
            Object c3 = new Mercedes();

        3. Abstraction: hiding implementation but showing the functionality
        4. Encapsulation: hiding data - better control of some data
